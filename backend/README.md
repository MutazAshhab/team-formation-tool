# My FastAPI Project

## Description

This is a sample FastAPI project with a predefined directory structure and necessary configuration files.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_fastapi_project.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory

Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd my_fastapi_project
```

### Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

It's often a good idea to create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. Here's how you can create one:

#### For macOS and Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can run the FastAPI application using:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI application, and it should be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
